# Code Smells kata

## The problem

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe.

There are a number of code smells in the implementation namely:

- Primitive obsession
- Feature envy
- Data class
- Message chain
- Long method
- Comments
- Long parameter list
- Shotgun surgery
- Duplicated code
- Large class
- Divergent change
- Data clump
- Lazy class
- Dead code

## Your task

Identify the code smells, add comments where you find code smells.
Refactor the code remembering the small steps we took on the refactoring golf exercise.
